# Data
'Data' directory for World of Warcraft custom Data changes such as Sounds or Fonts.

Merge this files into /Data directory to get profit:

- 'warmane' realmlist
- cyrillic fonts to see what exactly some russian scum wants to hide from you
- 'silent' sound replacement for Goblin Weather Machine, Argent Gruntling/Squire summon, Lament of the Highborne disgusting song, Fizzle spell sounds and so on
- script for unused SavedVariables cleanup for your /WTF (stolen from https://github.com/Soulsbane/WowRemoveUnusedSV)
- patch-S.MPQ - patch to colorize Lady Deathwisper spirits and hunters flare
