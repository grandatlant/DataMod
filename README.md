# Data
'Data' directory for World of Warcraft custom Data changes such as Sounds or Fonts.

Merge this files into Data directory to get profit:

- realmlist.wtf for warmane.com
- Creature/ replacement for Ghosts (Lady Deathwhisper ICC fight)
- Fonts/ for cyrillic charset
- Sound/ replacement for annoying sounds e.g. Goblin Weather Machine, Argent Gruntling/Squire, Lament of the Highborne song, Fizzle spell sounds, Character voice emotions
- [script](https://github.com/Soulsbane/WowRemoveUnusedSV) for SavedVariables cleanup in your WTF/ (stolen from https://github.com/Soulsbane/WowRemoveUnusedSV with WoW path override to "../")
